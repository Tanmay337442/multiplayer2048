# Multiplayer 2048
This game is a spin-off of the classic 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli, allowing two players to compete to reach the 2048 tile first. Communication between the client and the server is achieved through Socket.IO and Flask-SocketIO. Play the game at [https://multiplayer2048game.azurewebsites.net/](https://multiplayer2048game.azurewebsites.net/) - note that it is hosted on the Azure App Service free-tier plan and may take time to load.
